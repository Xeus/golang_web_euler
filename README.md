# Golang Web Euler Test

Learning golang by implementing net/http, project euler, and asserts/testing.

Also tests git branching/rebasing.

## Routes

* http://localhost:8080/euler/[problem #]/
* http://localhost:8080/euler/[problem #]/[variable num from problem, e.g. 1000 from #1]/

## Tests

Uses asserts as well.

`go test` to run tests from the `golang_web_euler` directory.
